in this configuration we block Ads,IR,China, and some malicious IP/sites reported by our VPS provider.

paste this config into xui->panel setting->xray configuration
then save and restart


if you want to allow Ads you just need to delete this line:
"geosite:category-ads-all",


if you want to allow chinese websites , delete these line:
"geosite:cn",
"geoip:cn",
